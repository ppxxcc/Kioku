# Kioku (Codename)

Kioku aims to be an efficient, adaptive, spaced repetition system (SRS).

## Introduction

Inspired by the SM6/SM7 algorithms of SuperMemo, Kioku aims to be an efficient and adaptive spaced repetition system, with a dynamic algorithm that adapts to user performance.

## Inspiration

I was a dedicated Anki user for many years, however, I am not very fond of the direction the Anki project is heading, especially in terms of UI and UX.
On the other hand, SuperMemo, while a great program that I have also used, is inherently tied to Windows with its reliance on Delphi and Internet Explorer backend, and in my opinion, is clearly not a sustainable option. In addition, it is a closed source, proprietary program.

Kioku aims to combine the best of both Anki and SuperMemo as I see fit. A cross-platform, modern SRS like Anki, with the superior algorithm of SuperMemo.

## Why Algorithm SM6/SM7

The algorithm of Kioku is inspired by the concepts of the SM6/SM7 algorithm, but is not a copy.
After having used both Anki and SuperMemo, I have been convinced in the superiority of SuperMemo's dynamic, adaptive algorithms, versus Anki's SM2 based, static algorithm. However, modern SM algorithms (such as those used in SM15, SM18) are too opaque in my opinion.
An SM6/SM7 style algorithm seems like a great balance between the simplicity of SM2 and the dynamic, adaptive, optimized nature of SM15/SM18.
